# :computer: Data Science & Machine Learning-60 Days-Course 

Hello and Welcome to the Data Science Course. :wave:

This is a course which will take you to the amazing world of Data Science and Machine learning.

This is designed in a the way that it will not walk you by holding your hands, you have to do tasks and also you need to contribute to the course by sharing your daily work done.

In many tutorials we might see that , ready tailored codes are given and just an explanation for that is provided alongwith, but when the problem statement/dataset gets changed then it is difficult to apply same strategies for the another problem statement.

# :pushpin: This course covers following topics - 
1. Python (Concepts and Packages required for Data Science)
1. R Language
1. SQL
1. Basic Mathematics required for machine learning
1. Statistics required for machine learning 
1. Machine Learning using both languages - Python and R
1. Model Building  and Validation
1. BI Tools - MS - BI and Tableau (Advanced topics)
1. Deep Learning and Neural Networks
1. and Further topics as suggested by participants...

# :pushpin: How to Proceed - 
Everyday, one task is provided as a coursework and you have to perfoem the required task which will not take more than an hour and you have to submit that task.
The task will be checked and then suggestions/Corrections will be provided for the same, along with the solution for the task.

On next day , previous day's tasks and syllabus is summed up in very structured manner for the further reference of participants. 

This will be all available on public repository on Github.
If you have any queries then please contact me personally.

So, thank you, and welcome to the world of Data Science and Machine Learning!
