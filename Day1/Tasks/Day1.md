Also to note, it is good practice to setup Github profiles individually so that our course work will be uploaded to that repository. for the same you will need -

install git for windows/mac/linux - 
https://git-scm.com/downloads

Also to get rid of programming on git initially, you will also required to install - Git Desktop 
https://desktop.github.com/

Don't worry we will be having separate discussion on git just keep these things ready, take help of web.

If there is any query , let us know.
